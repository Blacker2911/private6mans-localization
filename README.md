## Basic Instructions
* When translating messages please maintain basic formatting and leave variables for injection in place (`{{key}}`).
* Some special formatting such as `**BoldText**`, or `_ItalicText_` may exist in text and is markdown formatting for discord, please translate phrases inside the formatting as if they are independent of the rest of the message.
* Ensure that each line ends with a comma `,` outside of the closing quotes for the translated string.
* Ensure that no extra whitespace exists at the end of the line.

### Definitions
